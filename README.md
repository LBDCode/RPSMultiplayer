# RPSMultiplayer

This is a two player rock/paper/scissors game that uses firebase's realtime database.  To play, first make sure you have two players/connections.  Each player enters their name, and then can select their RPS choice by clicking on of the icons.  Once both players have made a selection, the game determines a winner and updates the score on each player's screen.  Players can also chat with each other by using the message feature at the bottom.

The game ends when one player leaves.
